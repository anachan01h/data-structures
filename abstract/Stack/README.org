* Stack

Let ~T~ be a data type. A *stack* of type ~T~, denoted by ~Stack<T>~, is a sequence of objects of type ~T~ with the following methods:
- ~push(value: T)~: inserts ~value~ to the top of stack;
- ~pop() -> T~: removes a value from the top of stack, and returns it.

*Note:* the top of a stack is the end of its sequence.
